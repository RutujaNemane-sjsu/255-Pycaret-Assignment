# 255-Pycaret-Assignment

This repository contains Google Colab notebooks demonstrating various machine learning tasks using the PyCaret low-code library. The tasks include classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting, all implemented with different datasets. The models are trained using GPU acceleration where applicable.

**Tasks Implemented**
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the tasks implemented using PyCaret:

_Classification_
Demonstrates binary and multi-class classification with datasets like Wine and Satellite.

_Regression_
Shows how to build regression models to predict continuous values like house prices.

_Clustering_
Implements unsupervised learning to group data into clusters using algorithms like KMeans.

_Anomaly Detection_
Identifies outliers or rare events using techniques like Isolation Forest.

_Association rule mining_
FInding what items will be brought with other items using association rules.

_Time Series Forecasting_
Predicts future values based on historical data with time series forecasting models.
