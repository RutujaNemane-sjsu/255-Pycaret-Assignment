# 255-Pycaret-Assignment

This repository contains Google Colab notebooks demonstrating various machine learning tasks using the PyCaret low-code library. The tasks include classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting, all implemented with different datasets. The models are trained using GPU acceleration where applicable.

## Tasks Implemented

**Classification**
Demonstrates binary and multi-class classification with datasets like Wine and Satellite.

**Regression**
Shows how to build regression models to predict continuous values like house prices.

**Clustering**
Implements unsupervised learning to group data into clusters using algorithms like KMeans.

**Anomaly Detection**
Identifies outliers or rare events using techniques like Isolation Forest.

**Association rule mining**
FInding what items will be brought with other items using association rules.

**Time Series Forecasting**
Predicts future values based on historical data with time series forecasting models.
