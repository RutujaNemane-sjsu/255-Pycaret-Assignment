# 255-Pycaret-Assignment

This repository contains Google Colab notebooks demonstrating various machine learning tasks using the PyCaret low-code library. The tasks include classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting, all implemented with different datasets. The models are trained using GPU acceleration where applicable.

## Tasks Implemented
